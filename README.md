## Overview

This repository hosts a project that combines machine learning with bioinformatics to investigate potential biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. By integrating robust software engineering practices with advanced bioinformatic techniques, we have built a reproducible pipeline to analyze biomedical datasets, preprocess the data, train models, and validate findings using tools such as BLAST.

## Project Motivation

Alzheimer's disease continues to challenge the medical community in diagnosis and treatment. Our project is designed to:

- **Identify Biomarkers:** Utilize classification models to distinguish between Alzheimer's-related genetic sequences and non-related sequences.
- **Validation Integration:** Run BLAST searches to align unknown sequences with known Alzheimer's genes.
- **Showcase Engineering Excellence:** Implement best coding practices including modularity, documentation, testing, and scalability.

This work bridges cutting-edge machine learning methods with practical software engineering to provide insights into one of the most complex neurodegenerative disorders.

## How to Run
- **Phenotype:**
  	dfdsf
- **Gene Sequencing:**
  	There is two important files to run one is the data file GDS4758.soft which stores all the data for gene sequencing. By saving this file 	in the same folder as the 123a gene sequence anyalsis.py and running the application should work and give you all the anyalsis done for 	the gene sequencing.
